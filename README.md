# Unity---A-Walk-In-the-Park
 A WALK IN THE PARK is an android based game which was developed by using unity engine . The main focus of the game is to play an open world game and complete a couple of missions.  To develop the game I took inspirations from various open world and simulation games such GTA liberty city ,  GTA vice city and EA sim city. To develop the assets or 3D models I used a software known as 3DS max.  The coding of the game is done in mono developer software.  The coding is done C# language.  This game can be played anywhere is your android mobile phone. I wanted to understand more about game development and design and therefore I chose this field for the project.
